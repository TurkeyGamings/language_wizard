# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We support the latest minor release on the default branch. Please update to the most recent version before filing a report.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Email **[git@sunsung.fun](mailto:git@sunsung.fun)** with subject `SECURITY: <short summary>`. Include affected version, environment, impact, clear reproduction steps, and a minimal PoC if possible. **Do not open public issues or PRs** for security reports.

**We will:**

* Acknowledge your report within **72 hours**.
* Provide an initial assessment or mitigation plan within **14 days**.
* Aim to fix or provide mitigations within **90 days** (timeline may vary with complexity).

## Disclosure

Please keep your report private until a fix is released. We will coordinate a public advisory and **credit you** (unless you request otherwise).

## Out of Scope

* Social engineering or physical attacks.
* Pure DoS/spam without a concrete, actionable fix.
* Automated scan results without demonstrated exploitability.
* Issues affecting only unsupported versions or non-default configs.
* Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies (please report upstream).

## Safe Harbor

If you follow this policy and act in good faith, we will not pursue legal action or block your research.

## Security Updates

Security fixes are shipped as **patch releases** and noted in the changelog/release notes.
